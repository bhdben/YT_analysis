# YT_analysis

For this project, I wanted to get real-world data to play with. To do this, I took advantage of YouTube's API. Using the API, I was able to extract all the video data from Mr. Beasts' YouTube channel (the biggest Youtuber of all time). Below is a quick summary of the steps I took to complete this.

1) Connect to YouTube using the API. Using the documentation on YouTube's developer website and a JSON formator, I was able to get the information I needed.

2) Ensure data is clean and useable. This mainly consisted of converting strings into date-times and integers, but another important part of this step was ensuring I did not have any missing values.

3) Some basic exploration. created a few graphs to give me an idea of what I was working with.

4) Export the data to a CSV file. this would allow for further analysis, or if I was a part of a team I could forward this file to my teammates.

Main Takeaways: 
1) I learned a ton about collecting data from APIs. I can apply what I've learned here to any other API.
2) I became more comfortable wrangling JSON files. I remember when I started I was really scared of them but now they make sense.
3) I used real-world data that I collected, which helped my confidence tremendously.
